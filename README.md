# Cake Tools
Tools to make life on Team Cake easier!

## Link Replacer
Temporarily replaces customer links with partlow links inside the Zendesk ticket. Org ID is pulled from the `org_id` input box on the left. If `org_id` is blank, the pop-up will instruct you to fill it out. Right now, this is the only tool, so just click the icon.
